# Challenge 04: Send Shortlist Reports to the Hiring Manager via Email

## Introduction
The HR Interview Copilot can now evaluate resumes and generate personalized insights for HR.  
In this challenge, you will enhance the Copilot to automatically generate a **shortlist report** and email it to the **Hiring Manager** once HR approves.

This transforms the Copilot into a practical assistant that supports the full recruitment workflow, not just conversations.

## Challenge Objectives
- Request HR approval before sending the shortlist report.
- Trigger a Power Automate flow using Outlook.
- Email the Hiring Manager a structured candidate report based on evaluation results.
- Notify the user that the email has been successfully sent.

## Steps to Complete

### Step 1: Capture HR consent after resume evaluation

1. Open the **Resume Fit & Evaluation** topic in Copilot Studio.

1. Under data sources in **Generative answers** node, click on **edit**.

1. In the configuration pane, scroll down to bottom and expand **Advanced >** option.

1. Once expanded, under **Save bot response as**, click on the input area and Select **Create new variable**. This will create a new variable to save the agent response.

1. After the final **Generative answers** node, click **+ Add node**.

1. Select **Ask a question**.

1. Enter the following prompt:

   ```
   Would you like me to send the shortlist report to the Hiring Manager?
   ```

1. As the response type, by default will be **Multiple Choice**, add the below choices:

   - Yes  

   - No  

1. Copilot Studio will create two branches automatically.

### Step 2: Configure the **No** branch

1. Under the **No** branch, add a **Send a message** node.

1. Enter: `No worries. Let me know if you need help with anything else in the hiring process.`

1. This closes the evaluation workflow gracefully.

1. Click on save, to save the topic, you will configure **Yes** branch later.

### Step 3: Create a Power Automate flow (Send Email to Hiring Manager)

1. In Copilot Studio, from the left navigation pane, select **Flows** and click **+ New agent flow**

1. You will be navigated to **Designer** pane, under the add a trigger pane, search for **When an agent calls the flow** and select it.

1. Inside **When an agent calls the flow** node, select **Add an input** option to add a **Text** input variable and provide the name as **Body**.

1. Once configured, add one more node by clicking on **+**.

1. Search for **Compose** and select it, It helps to perform operations on the Data. The agent returns responses in Markdown format (using ** for bold, * for italics, etc.). Since Outlook doesn't render Markdown natively, we need to convert these Markdown elements to HTML tags before sending the email. This ensures proper formatting when recipients view the message.

1. In the **Compose** node, click on the input area and select the function icon (fx) to add an expression.

1. In the function area, add the below expression and click **Add**.

   ```
   replace(replace(replace(replace(triggerBody()?['text'], '**', '<b>'), '- ', '<br>• '), '\n', '<br>'), '*', '<em>')
   ```
1. Once configured, add one more node by clicking on **+**.

1. Search and Choose **Send an email (V2)** node under office 365 outlook section.

1. Once added, please configure the connection using **Sign in** option. Use the same credentials provided for the lab to sign in and allow access.

1. Once done, in the configuration pane, provide **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>** in the **To** parameter.

1. Configure the flow:

   - **Subject:** `Candidate Evaluation Report`

   - **Body:** Click on the input area of the parameter and type `/`, click on **Insert Dynamic Content** and select **Outputs** variable under **Compose**. This will pull the value from the output of compose node.

1. Select **Publish** to publish the flow.  

1. Once published, open the **Overview** page of Agent Flows and click **Edit** on the Details card.  

1. Change the flow name from **Untitled** to **Outlook Flow**.  

1. Select **Save**.

### Step 4: Connect the flow to the “Yes” branch

1. Navigate back to **Agents** from left menu, select **HR Interview Copilot**.

1. In the **Resume Fit & Evaluation** topic, under the **Yes** branch, click **+ Add node**.

1. From the list, select **Add a tool** and click on the **Outlook Flow** which you created earlier.

1. Select the input variable **Body** as **Var 3** variable, where the agent response will be stored.

1. After that node, add a **Send a message** node and enter:

   ```
   The shortlist report has been emailed to the Hiring Manager.
   ```

1. Click **Save** (top-right) to finalize the updated topic.

## Test the Shortlist Workflow

1. Click **Test** (top-right).

1. Trigger the Resume Fit & Evaluation workflow:

1. Select **Yes**.

   >Note: If a pop up comes to **allow a connection**, please click on allow.
