# Challenge 03: Build Interview Topics for HR Support

## Introduction

The HR Interview Copilot now has access to **Job Descriptions** and **Resumes** through the Knowledge section.  
In this challenge, you will create two interactive interview topics that:
1) Ask the user for input  
2) Use uploaded documents as the grounding source  
3) Produce structured hiring insights based only on the provided documents

This ensures the Copilot behaves like a real HR assistant rather than a generic AI.

##  Challenge Objectives
- Create two interactive hiring topics using the new Copilot Studio UI
- Ask clarifying questions before generating responses
- Configure Generative answers to only use the uploaded knowledge documents

## Steps to Complete

### Topic 1: Interview Question Generator

1. Open the HR Interview Copilot, from the top navigation bar, select **Topics** and click on **+ Add a topic** and select **From Blank** to create a new topic.

   >If you don't see Topics option from top menu, expand the menu using **+** option and select **Topics** from the list.

1. In the topic setup panel, under **Describe what this topic does**, enter:

   ```
   Generates interview question sets based on the job role and experience level. It asks the user which role and seniority to focus on, then produces 6–10 technical and behavioural interview questions grounded in the Job Description documents.
   ```

1. In the topic flow editor, add a new **Ask a question** node and add the below question in the input area:

   ```
   Which role do you want interview questions for, Software Developer or AI Engineer?
   ```

1. Under Identify, select **User's entire response**.

   ```

### Topic 2: Resume Fit & Evaluation

1. Navigate back to **Topics** page, using top menu.

1. From the Topics page, click **+Add New topic** again.

1. In the topic setup panel, under **Describe what this topic does**, enter:

   ```
   Evaluates a resume against a job role to identify strengths, gaps and role alignment. It asks the user for the role and the candidate resume, then classifies suitability as Strong Fit, Partial Fit, or Poor Fit with justification grounded in the uploaded documents.
   ```

1. In the topic flow editor, add a new **Ask a question** node and add the below question in the input area:

   ```

   - In the edit pane, under **Knowledge Sources** enable **Search only selected sources** toggle.

   - From the list, select all the resume files, ones with the prefix `resume`.

1. Click Save from the top-right corner and provide the name for the topic:

   ```
   Resume Fit & Evaluation
   ```

## Test Both Topics

1. Ensure all files in the Knowledge tab show status **Ready**.

   >If your files are still in **in-progress** state, it will take up to 30 minutes to index all these files, please skip the test and continue with further configurations as you will be testing the complete agent further in this hackathon.

1. Click Test (top-right of Copilot Studio).

1. Trigger Interview Questions Generator by giving the below prompt and answer the questions asked by agent:

   ```
   Generate some interview questions
   ```
1. Trigger the Resume Fit & Evaluation workflow:

   ```
