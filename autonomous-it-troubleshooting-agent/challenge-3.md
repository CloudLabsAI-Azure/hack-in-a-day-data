# Challenge 03: Create Freshdesk Ticket Flow

## Introduction
Now that your Freshdesk account is ready, you'll create a reusable flow in Copilot Studio that connects to Freshdesk. This flow will be called by your topics to create support tickets automatically when users need assistance beyond self-service troubleshooting.

In this challenge, you will create an agent flow with the Freshdesk connector that automates ticket creation based on user input, streamlining the process for handling support requests.

- Navigate to Flows in Copilot Studio
- Configure the Flow
