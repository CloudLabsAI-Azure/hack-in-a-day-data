# Challenge 02: Setup Freshdesk & Get API Credentials

When the copilot cannot resolve an issue automatically, it needs to create a support ticket in your helpdesk system. Freshdesk is a popular cloud-based helpdesk solution that integrates seamlessly with Copilot Studio through its API connector.

In this challenge, you will activate your Freshdesk free trial, configure your account, and obtain the API credentials needed to connect Copilot Studio to Freshdesk for automated ticket creation.

- Activate Freshdesk free trial account
- Configure Freshdesk profile and settings
- Obtain API Key and Account URL
