# Challenge 01: Set Up Azure Infrastructure

## Introduction

Before building the AI-powered Data Security Agent, you need to provision the necessary Azure infrastructure. This challenge involves creating a Microsoft Foundry project with GPT-4.1-mini model deployment, Cosmos DB for storing scan results and security alerts, a Storage Account for hosting data assets, and an Event Grid Topic for event-driven alerting.

## Challenge Objectives

- Set up a Microsoft Foundry project with GPT model deployment
- Provision Cosmos DB with the SecurityAgentDB database and containers
- Create a Storage Account with blob containers for data assets
- Upload sample datasets to the Storage Account
- Create an Event Grid Topic for publishing security alerts
- Verify all resources are properly configured and accessible

   - **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit**: **50K**

      > **Important**: Do not increase the TPM limit beyond 50K to avoid exceeding quota limits and additional costs.

1. Click on **Deploy**.

   > **Note:** If you are unable to deploy gpt-4.1-mini or the quota shows as zero, try changing the deployment type to Standard. If the issue persists, deploy the gpt-4.1 model instead.

### Task 4: Test the Model Deployment

1. In your `data-security-model` model deployment.

1. Select **Open in playground**.

1. In the **Chat History** page, enter and test with this prompt:

   ```
   What are the key differences between PII, PHI, and PCI data classifications?
   ```

1. Verify you receive a response explaining the data classification categories.
