# Challenge 05: Configure Logic App, Run the Dashboard, and Test End-to-End

## Introduction

Your three-agent pipeline is operational. All the application code has been built for you. In this final challenge, you will create a Logic App to process Event Grid security alerts, configure and run the Streamlit web dashboard locally, and perform end-to-end testing of the complete Data Security Agent system.

## Prerequisites

- Completed Challenge 4 (all three agents created and connected)
- Event Grid Topic created in Challenge 1
- Cosmos DB and Storage Account configured with sample data

## Challenge Objectives

- Create a Logic App workflow that processes Event Grid security alerts
- Configure the Logic App to write alerts to Cosmos DB and send notifications
- Download and configure the Streamlit application
- Authenticate with Azure CLI
- Run the dashboard and test the multi-agent pipeline
- Verify end-to-end flow: Scan → Classification → Risk Detection → Compliance → Alerts

## Steps to Complete

### Task 1: Create Logic App

1. In the **Azure Portal**, search for **Logic Apps** and select it.

1. Click on **+ Add**.

1. Configure the Logic App:

   - **Subscription**: Select the available **Azure subscription**
   - **Resource Group**: Select **challenge-rg-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
   - **Logic App name**: **security-alert-processor-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
   - **Region**: Keep **Default**
   - **Plan type**: Select **Consumption**
   - **Zone redundancy**: Select **Disabled**

1. Click **Review + Create**, then **Create**.

1. Wait for the deployment to complete and click **Go to resource**.

### Task 2: Configure Logic App — Event Grid Trigger

1. In the Logic App, click on **Logic app designer** from the left navigation under **Development Tools**.

1. In the designer, under **Start with a common trigger**, select **When an Event Grid resource event occurs**.

   > **Note:** If you do not see this option, click **+ Add a trigger** and search for **Event Grid**.

1. If prompted to sign in, click **Sign in** and authenticate with your lab credentials:
   - Email: **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>**
   - Password: **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>**

1. Configure the Event Grid trigger:

   - **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription
   - **Resource Type**: Select **Microsoft.EventGrid.Topics**
   - **Resource Name**: Select **security-alerts-topic-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
   - **Event Type Item**: Leave as default (all events)

1. Click **+ New step** to add the next action.

### Task 3: Configure Logic App — Parse Event Data

1. Search for **Parse JSON** action and select it.

1. In the **Content** field, click the dynamic content panel. Under **When a resource event occurs**, select **Event data** (not Body).

   > **Important:** The Event Grid trigger already decomposes the event envelope into separate fields (Event data, Event Type, Subject, etc.). The **Event data** field contains the custom data payload where severity lives. Do NOT select Body — that would give you the full event envelope and the nested fields would not be directly accessible.

1. In the **Schema** field, click **Use sample payload to generate schema** and paste the following sample payload:

   ```json
   {
     "alert_id": "ALERT-001",
     "severity": "CRITICAL",
     "risk_id": "ACT-001",
     "description": "Intern bulk-exported 48500 rows of PII/PCI data at 2:47 AM",
     "user": "jake.morrison",
     "role": "Intern",
     "affected_data": ["SSN", "CreditCardNumber", "CVV"],
     "timestamp": "2025-06-15T02:47:00Z",
     "requires_approval": true,
     "scan_id": "scan-20250615-001"
   }
   ```

   > **Note:** This is just the `data` portion of the Event Grid event — not the full event object. Since the trigger already extracts Event data for you, you only need to parse the inner payload.

1. Click **Done** to generate the schema. You should see fields like `severity`, `alert_id`, `description`, `user`, `role`, etc. in the generated schema.

### Task 4: Configure Logic App — Condition and Actions

1. Click **+ New step**. Search for and select **Condition** (under Control).

1. In the Condition, configure:

   - Click the left value field, select **severity** from the Parse JSON dynamic content
   - Set the operator to **is equal to**
   - Set the right value to **CRITICAL**

1. In the **If true** branch, click **Add an action**.

1. Search for **Azure Cosmos DB** and select **Create or update document (V3)**.

1. If prompted, create a new connection:

   - **Connection Name**: Enter `SecurityCosmosDB`
   - **Authentication Type**: Select **Access Key**
   - **Account ID**: Enter your Cosmos DB account name: `security-agent-cosmos-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>`
   - **Access Key to your Azure Cosmos DB account**: Paste the **PRIMARY KEY** you saved from Challenge 1
   - Click **Create**.

1. Configure the Cosmos DB action:

   - **Database ID**: Select **SecurityAgentDB** or enter `SecurityAgentDB`
   - **Container ID**: Select **SecurityAlerts** or enter `SecurityAlerts`
   - **Document**: Enter the following (use dynamic content where indicated):

     ```json
     {
       "id": "@{guid()}",
       "alertId": "@{body('Parse_JSON')?['alert_id']}",
       "severity": "@{body('Parse_JSON')?['severity']}",
       "description": "@{body('Parse_JSON')?['description']}",
       "user": "@{body('Parse_JSON')?['user']}",
       "role": "@{body('Parse_JSON')?['role']}",
       "timestamp": "@{body('Parse_JSON')?['timestamp']}",
       "scanId": "@{body('Parse_JSON')?['scan_id']}",
       "status": "OPEN",
       "processedAt": "@{utcNow()}"
     }
     ```

   - **Partition Key Value**: Enter `CRITICAL`

   > **Note:** If you see a multi-line text box, click **Switch to input text format** to enter the JSON directly. You can also use the **Code view** to paste the JSON directly.

1. In the **If false** branch (for non-CRITICAL alerts), click **Add an action**.

1. Search for **Azure Cosmos DB** and select **Create or update document (V3)** again.

1. Use the same connection and configure:

   - **Database ID**: `SecurityAgentDB`
   - **Container ID**: `SecurityAlerts`
   - **Document**:

     ```json
     {
       "id": "@{guid()}",
       "alertId": "@{body('Parse_JSON')?['alert_id']}",
       "severity": "@{body('Parse_JSON')?['severity']}",
       "description": "@{body('Parse_JSON')?['description']}",
       "user": "@{body('Parse_JSON')?['user']}",
       "role": "@{body('Parse_JSON')?['role']}",
       "timestamp": "@{body('Parse_JSON')?['timestamp']}",
       "scanId": "@{body('Parse_JSON')?['scan_id']}",
       "status": "OPEN",
       "processedAt": "@{utcNow()}"
     }
     ```

   - **Partition Key Value**: Enter `HIGH`

1. Click **Save** at the top of the Logic App designer to save the workflow.

- **cosmos_helper.py** — Cosmos DB operations (save scan results, save alerts, query history)
- **storage_helper.py** — Azure Blob Storage operations (read schemas, policies, logs)
- **event_grid_helper.py** — Event Grid publishing (CRITICAL and HIGH risk alerts)

**Key features:**
- Azure CLI authentication using DefaultAzureCredential
- Fast Scan (top 5 rows) and Full Scan (all rows) modes
- Real-time progress tracking with status indicators
- Animated gradient header and severity-coded badges
- Connection status dots in the sidebar (animated pulse)
- Automatic Event Grid publishing for critical/high risks
- Cosmos DB persistence for scan history and alerts
- Six-tab dashboard interface

### Task 10: Install Dependencies

1. In the terminal, run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. This installs:

   - `streamlit` — Web framework
   - `azure-ai-agents` — Azure AI Agents SDK
   - `azure-ai-projects` — Microsoft Foundry SDK
   - `azure-identity` — Azure authentication
   - `azure-cosmos` — Cosmos DB SDK
   - `azure-storage-blob` — Blob Storage SDK
   - `azure-eventgrid` — Event Grid SDK
   - `python-dotenv` — Environment variables
   - `pandas` — Data processing

### Task 11: Run the Application

1. Start the Streamlit app:

   **Windows PowerShell:**

   ```powershell
   $env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")

   streamlit run app.py
   ```

1. Enter the email as **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>** and press Enter.

1. The application will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501` or `http://localhost:8502`.

### Task 12: Test the Security Scan Pipeline

1. You will see an animated gradient header: **"Data Security & Compliance Agent"**.

1. In the **sidebar**, verify connection status indicators:
   - Agent: Green dot (connected)
   - Cosmos DB: Green dot (connected)
   - Storage: Green dot (connected)
   - Event Grid: Green dot (connected)

1. Set the **Scan Mode** to **Fast Scan** (reads top 5 rows per table for faster results).

1. Navigate to the **Scan Data Assets** tab.

1. Click the **Run Security Scan** button.

1. Watch the progress indicators:
   - Loading data from Storage Account...
   - Building scan prompt...
   - Sending to Classification Agent...
   - Agent processing (Classification → Risk Detection → Compliance)...
   - Publishing alerts to Event Grid...
   - Saving results to Cosmos DB...
   - Scan complete.

1. After completion, a gradient completion banner appears and the results populate across tabs.

### Task 13: Explore the Results

1. Navigate to the **Classification** tab:
   - View the classification table for all columns across all datasets
   - Check the metric cards: PII Count, PHI Count, PCI Count, Confidential, Public
   - Verify SSN columns are classified as PII, card numbers as PCI, diagnoses as PHI

1. Navigate to the **Risk Detection** tab:
   - View the risk summary: Critical, High, Medium, Low counts
   - Check the access policy risks table (over-privileged roles)
   - Check the activity anomalies table (after-hours exports, foreign IPs)
   - Verify the intern's 2:47 AM bulk export is flagged as CRITICAL

1. Navigate to the **Remediation** tab:
   - View the compliance score (should be low given the sample data risks)
   - Check the remediation playbook with priorities and assigned owners
   - Review the approval queue for actions requiring human sign-off
   - Verify regulation mappings (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)

1. Navigate to the **Alerts & Approvals** tab:
   - View alerts written to Cosmos DB by the Logic App
   - Check alert severity and status

   > **Note:** Event Grid alerts are processed by the Logic App asynchronously. Alerts may take a few moments to appear in Cosmos DB after the scan completes.

1. Navigate to the **Scan History** tab:
   - View past scan records stored in Cosmos DB
   - Verify the scan you just ran appears with its timestamp and results summary

### Task 14: Run a Full Scan

1. In the sidebar, switch to **Full Scan** mode.

1. Click **Run Security Scan** again.

1. This scan processes all sample rows (not just the top 5) and takes longer.

1. Compare the Full Scan results with the Fast Scan — the classifications should be consistent, and the risk detection may find additional patterns in the complete log data.

### Task 15: Verify Event Grid and Logic App Flow

1. Go to the **Azure Portal** and navigate to your Logic App: **security-alert-processor-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

1. Click on **Overview** and check the **Runs history** section.

1. You should see one or more successful runs triggered by the Event Grid alerts from your scans.

1. Click on a run to see the execution details:
   - Event Grid trigger fired
   - JSON parsed
   - Condition evaluated (CRITICAL or not)
   - Document created in Cosmos DB

1. Navigate to **Cosmos DB** → **Data Explorer** → **SecurityAgentDB** → **SecurityAlerts**.

1. Verify that alert documents were created by the Logic App with the correct severity, description, and status.
