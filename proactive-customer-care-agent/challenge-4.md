# Challenge 04: Create Topics Using Generative AI

## Introduction
Instead of manually building conversation flows from scratch, Microsoft Copilot Studio allows you to create topics using generative AI. Simply describe what you want the topic to do, and AI will generate the conversation flow, trigger phrases, and responses automatically. You'll then connect these topics to your CustomerServiceFlow for ticket escalation.

In this challenge, you will create 4 essential customer care topics using generative AI: Order Tracking Assistance, Product Return Processing, Delivery Delay Management, and Service Quality Complaint Handling. Each topic will call your published CustomerServiceFlow when escalation is needed.

## Challenge Objectives
- Use Copilot Studio's generative AI to create 4 topics
- Review All Topics
- Connect Topics to CustomerServiceFlow

## Steps to Complete

### Step 1: Navigate to Topics Section

1. In your **Customer Care Copilot Agent**, click **Topics** in the navigation pane.

1. You'll see existing system topics (Conversation Start, Fallback, Error).

1. Click **+ Add a topic**.

1. Select **Add from description with Copilot**.

### Step 2: Create Topic 1 - Order Tracking Assistance

1. In the topic creation dialog, enter the following details:

   - **Name:** `OrderTrackingAssistance`
   - **Description:**

      ```
      Help customers track their orders and provide delivery status updates. Ask the customer for their order number and save it as a variable. Use generative answers to retrieve order status information from the uploaded knowledge sources whenever possible. Provide estimated delivery dates, current shipping status, and tracking links. After sharing the tracking information, ask the customer whether they need additional assistance. If the customer reports an issue with tracking or needs human support, offer to create a support ticket. When creating the ticket, generate a subject line such as "Order Tracking Request - <order number>" and create a detailed description that includes the order number and any specific concerns raised by the customer. Map these values to the CustomerServiceFlow inputs for Subject and Description so the flow receives the correct variables. This topic should act as a self-service order tracking helper that uses the knowledge base first and escalates to ticket creation only when needed.
      ```

1. Click on **Create**.

1. Wait for the AI to generate the topic (15-30 seconds).

1. Review the generated topic:

   - **Trigger phrases:** Verify it includes phrases like:
   - "Track my order"
   - "Where is my package"
   - "Order status"
   - "Delivery tracking"
   - "Track shipment"

1. Review the conversation flow:

1. **Important:** If you see an error about limited scope or variables:
   - Open the **Variables** pane.
   - Click on each variable under **Topic**.
   - Enable the both the checkbox for **Receive values from other topics** or **Return values to original topics** for Variables which shows error.

1. Click **Save** to keep this topic.

### Step 3: Create Topic 2 - Product Return Processing

1. Click **+ Add a topic**.

1. Select **Add from description with Copilot**.

1. Enter the following details:

    - **Name:** `ProductReturnProcessing`
    - **Description:**

        ```
        Assist customers who want to return or exchange products. Ask the customer for their order number and save it as a variable, then ask them to describe the reason for the return and save that as another variable. Use generative answers to provide return policy information, return windows, refund timelines, and return shipping instructions by referring to the uploaded knowledge sources. Provide step-by-step guidance for initiating returns through the customer portal or by mail. After sharing the return process, ask the customer whether they understand the steps or need help proceeding. If the customer requests assistance with processing the return or has questions about eligibility, offer to create a support ticket. When creating the ticket, generate a subject line using the order number, for example "Product Return Request - <order number>," and generate a detailed description that includes the order number and the reason for return provided by the customer. Map these values to the CustomerServiceFlow inputs for Subject and Description so the flow receives the correct variables. This topic should handle all return and exchange requests but escalate to human agents when customer needs assistance with processing.
        ```

1. Click **Create** or **Generate**.

1. Review and customize the generated topic:

   - **Trigger phrases:** Verify it includes phrases like:
   - "I want to return a product"
   - "Return my order"
   - "Exchange item"
   - "Refund request"
   - "Return policy"

1. Review the conversation flow:

1. **Important:** If you see an error about limited scope or variables:
   - Open the **Variables** pane.
   - Click on each variable under **Topic**.
   - Enable the both the checkbox for **Receive values from other topics** or **Return values to original topics** for Variables which shows error.

1. Click **Save**.

### Step 4: Create Topic 3 - Delivery Delay Management

1. Click **+ Add a topic**.

1. Select **Add from description with Copilot**.

1. Enter the following details:

   - **Name:** `DeliveryDelayManagement`
   - **Description:**

      ```
      Help customers who are experiencing delayed deliveries or missed delivery windows. Ask the customer for their order number and save it as a variable, then ask them to describe the delivery issue in their own words and save that as another variable. Use generative answers to provide information about common delivery delays, carrier issues, weather impacts, and estimated resolution times by referring to the uploaded knowledge sources. Provide troubleshooting steps such as checking tracking status, verifying delivery address, contacting the carrier, or scheduling redelivery. After providing assistance, ask the customer whether the issue is resolved or if they need further help. If the customer indicates the delay is unacceptable or requests compensation, offer to create a support ticket for priority handling. When creating the ticket, generate a subject line such as "Delivery Delay - <order number>" and create a detailed description that includes the order number, delivery issue details, and customer concerns. Map these values to the CustomerServiceFlow inputs for Subject and Description so the flow receives the correct variables. This topic should provide self-service solutions for delivery issues but escalate to human agents when customers need priority assistance or compensation.
      ```

1. Click **Create** or **Generate**.

1. Review and customize the generated topic:

   - **Trigger phrases:** Verify it includes phrases like:
   - "My delivery is late"
   - "Order not delivered"
   - "Delayed shipment"
   - "Package not arrived"
   - "Missed delivery"

1. Review the conversation flow:

1. **Important:** If you see an error about limited scope or variables:
   - Open the **Variables** pane.
   - Click on each variable under **Topic**.
   - Enable the both the checkbox for **Receive values from other topics** or **Return values to original topics** for Variables which shows error.

1. Click on **Save**.

### Step 5: Create Topic 4 - Service Quality Complaint Handling

1. Click **+ Add a topic**.

1. Select **Add from description with Copilot**.

1. Enter the following details:

   - **Name:** `ServiceQualityComplaintHandling`
   - **Description:**

      ```
      Handle customer complaints about service quality, product defects, poor customer service experiences, or other issues. Begin by asking the customer to describe their complaint or concern in detail and save this as a variable. Ask if the complaint is related to a specific order, and if yes, ask for the order number and save it as another variable. Use generative answers to acknowledge the complaint empathetically and provide relevant company policies, quality standards, or resolution processes from the uploaded knowledge sources. Offer immediate solutions such as replacement, refund, discount codes, or service credits when appropriate based on knowledge base guidance. After presenting potential solutions, ask the customer whether they are satisfied with the proposed resolution. If the customer is not satisfied or requests to escalate the complaint to management, offer to create a priority support ticket. When creating the ticket, generate a subject line such as "Service Quality Complaint - <order number if provided, otherwise Customer Concern>" and create a detailed description that includes all complaint details, order information if applicable, and resolution attempts already made. Map these values to the CustomerServiceFlow inputs for Subject and Description so the flow receives the correct variables. This topic should handle complaints professionally with empathy while offering immediate solutions, and escalate to human agents only when the customer is not satisfied with automated resolution options.
      ```

1. Click **Create** or **Generate**.

1. Review and customize the generated topic:
