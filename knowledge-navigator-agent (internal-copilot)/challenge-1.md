# Challenge 01: Create Internal Knowledge Copilot in Copilot Studio

## Introduction
Employees across organizations waste valuable time searching for internal policies, procedures, and guidelines scattered across different departments. Traditional document repositories and file shares make it difficult to find relevant information quickly, leading to repeated questions to managers and colleagues.

In this challenge, you will create an AI-powered Internal Knowledge Copilot using Microsoft Copilot Studio that will serve as your intelligent assistant to help employees access information from HR, Finance, IT, and Procurement departments.

## Accessing the Datasets

Please download and extract the datasets required for this challenge here:

```

## Challenge Objectives
- Sign in to Microsoft Copilot Studio
- Create a new agent for internal knowledge navigation
- Configure basic agent settings and identity
- Prepare for knowledge base upload in the next challenge

## Steps to Complete

### Step 1: Create SharePoint Site

- Navigate to the **Microsoft 365** portal:

   ```
   https://www.office.com
   ```

- Sign in with the provided credentials:
   - **Email/Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
   - **Password:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

- If prompted with **"Stay signed in?"**, click **No**.

- From the Microsoft 365 apps, select **SharePoint**.

- Click on **+ Create site** and select **Team site**.

- Configure the new site:
   - **Site name:** **contoso-documents-<inject key="DeploymentID"></inject>**
   - **Site description:** "Internal knowledge base for company policies and procedures"
   - **Privacy settings:** Set to **Public** (anyone in the organization can access)

- Click **Next** and add any additional owners if needed, then click **Finish**.

- Once the site is created, navigate to the **Documents** section.

- You can upload files now or in Challenge 2. To upload now, click **Upload** > **Files** and select all documents from where you have extracted the datasets.

- Wait for all files to upload successfully (this may take several minutes for 40+ documents).

- **Copy the SharePoint site URL** from the browser address bar and paste it into **Notepad** for use in upcoming steps.

   Example format: **https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/contoso-documents-<inject key="DeploymentID"></inject>**

- Navigate to **Microsoft Copilot Studio**:

   ```
   https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com
   ```

- Ensure the environment is **ODL_User<inject key="DeploymentID"></inject>**.

### Step 2: Create a New Agent

1. In Copilot Studio, select **Agents** from the left navigation pane, and then click **Create blank agent** to start creating a new agent.

1. On the overview pane of the agent, click on **edit** inside the Details card to edit the agent's name and description.

1. Configure the agent details as follows:

   - **Name:** `Internal Knowledge Navigator`

   - **Description:** `This agent helps employees quickly find Contoso company policies, procedures, and guidelines across all departments including HR, IT, Procurement, Finance, Sales, and Operations. It provides accurate answers with document citations from official company documents, guides users through common processes, and can trigger helpful actions like emailing documents or creating support tickets.`

1. Click on **Save**.

1. Once done, scroll down and add the following **instructions** by clicking on **edit** inside the Instruction card.

     ```
     - Respond only to queries related to Contoso internal company policies, procedures, business operations, and department-specific guidelines.
     - Retrieve knowledge from the uploaded Contoso company documents stored in SharePoint, including HR handbooks, IT governance policies, procurement procedures, support policies, sales playbooks, business reports, and operational data.
     - When answering questions:
       - Provide clear, accurate information based strictly on official Contoso documents
       - Always cite the source document name (e.g., Contoso_HR_Handbook.docx)
       - Use professional, helpful language appropriate for internal employees
       - If information isn't in the knowledge base, direct users to the appropriate department contact
     - For common scenarios, guide users through step-by-step processes based on documented procedures
     - Offer to email policy documents or create support tickets when appropriate
     - Maintain employee privacy and confidentiality at all times
     - Focus on providing information from official Contoso documents rather than general knowledge
     ```

1. Click on **Save**.

### Step 3: Test Basic Agent Greeting

- Click the **Test** button to open the test panel on the right side.

- In the test pane, the agent should greet you with the welcome message.

- Try typing a simple question like:
   - "Hello"
   - "What can you help me with?"

- Verify that the agent responds appropriately with the greeting.

- Note that specific knowledge questions won't work yet. You'll add knowledge sources in the next challenge.

### Step 4: Save Your Progress

- Ensure all settings are saved.

- Keep the Copilot Studio browser tab open for the next challenge.

- Take note of your copilot name: **Internal Knowledge Navigator**
