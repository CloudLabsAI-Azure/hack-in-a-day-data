# Knowledge Navigator Agent (Internal Copilot) – Hack in a Day

Welcome to the Knowledge Navigator Agent (Internal Copilot) Hack in a Day! Today, you'll learn how to build an AI-powered internal knowledge assistant that helps employees search and access 40+ Contoso company documents across multiple departments. Through this hands-on experience, you'll create an agent with conversational topics, agent flows, and deploy it to Microsoft Teams.

## Scenario

As Contoso continues to grow, employees are finding it increasingly difficult to locate information spread across multiple departments such as HR, Finance, IT, Procurement, Sales, and Operations. Common questions from “Where can I find the expense reimbursement policy?” to “What is the process to request new hardware?”, generate thousands of internal support emails every month. To eliminate knowledge silos and reduce dependency on manual help, the company decides to build a Knowledge Navigator Agent that can instantly search internal documents, answer employee questions, and share the right files or send requests to Teams channels. The goal is to streamline knowledge access and boost productivity across the organization.

## Introduction

Your mission is to build a **Knowledge Navigator Agent** that helps employees quickly find information from Contoso's comprehensive document library including HR, Finance, IT, Procurement, Sales, Support, and Operations documents. Using Microsoft Copilot Studio's no-code platform, you'll create a conversational AI assistant that searches through company policies and procedures, provides accurate answers from the knowledge base, and can trigger automated actions.

The agent will serve as a centralized knowledge hub for employees, capable of answering questions about HR handbooks, procurement policies, IT governance, expense reimbursements, sales playbooks, and more. You'll also create agent flows to email documents to employees and post requests to Microsoft Teams channels – all without writing a single line of code.

## Key Tools / Services

In this lab, you will primarily work with:

- **Microsoft Copilot Studio** - No-code platform for building conversational AI agents
- **SharePoint** - For storing and indexing 40+ Contoso company documents
- **Agent Flows** - Created within Copilot Studio (not Power Automate portal) for automated actions
- **Generative AI Topics** - AI-generated conversational topics from natural language descriptions
- **Microsoft Teams** - For deploying the agent and receiving request notifications
- **Office 365 Connectors** - For email and Teams integrations within agent flows

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Create and configure an internal knowledge navigator agent in Microsoft Copilot Studio
- Connect SharePoint as a knowledge source with 40+ company documents
- Create a Microsoft Teams channel for receiving requests
- Build agent flows within Copilot Studio for automated actions (email documents, post to Teams)
- Use generative AI to create conversational topics from natural language descriptions
- Connect topics to agent flows and map variables between them
- Deploy and test your agent in Microsoft Teams
- Implement best practices for enterprise knowledge management with AI agents

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This hack in a day adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through five progressive stages that build a complete Internal Knowledge Navigator Agent. Each challenge focuses on a key capability:

- **Challenge 1: Create Agent and SharePoint Site** – Set up Copilot Studio agent, create SharePoint site, and upload 40+ Contoso documents
- **Challenge 2: Connect SharePoint Knowledge Source** – Connect SharePoint to your agent, create Teams channel for requests, disable web search
- **Challenge 3: Create Agent Flows for Actions** – Build two agent flows within Copilot Studio: Email Document to Employee and Send Request to Teams
- **Challenge 4: Create Topics Using Generative AI** - Use AI to generate 3 conversational topics and connect them to your agent flows
- **Challenge 5: Publish Agent to Microsoft Teams** – Deploy your agent to Teams, test all topics and flows, configure availability

Throughout each challenge, you'll:
- Build practical, real-world AI agent capabilities using no-code tools
- Learn through hands-on configuration within Copilot Studio
- See immediate results as you test each topic and flow
- Create a production-ready agent deployed to Microsoft Teams

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with creating a new agent in Microsoft Copilot Studio, setting up a SharePoint site, and uploading 40+ Contoso company documents covering HR, IT, Procurement, Finance, Sales, Support, and Operations. You'll connect this SharePoint site as your agent's knowledge source and create a Microsoft Teams channel to receive employee requests.

Next, you'll build two agent flows entirely within Copilot Studio (no external Power Automate portal): one to email documents to employees and another to post requests to the Teams channel you created. These flows will use Office 365 Outlook and Microsoft Teams connectors.

Then, you'll use Copilot Studio's generative AI feature to create 3 conversational topics by simply describing what you want in natural language. The AI will generate trigger phrases, conversation flows, and variable capturing automatically. You'll create topics for emailing documents, submitting requests, and new employee onboarding. Two of these topics will call your agent flows. The agent will also answer document search queries automatically using the SharePoint knowledge source.

Finally, you'll publish your agent to Microsoft Teams, test all topics and flows end-to-end, and make it available to your organization. By the end of this hack in a day, you'll have a fully functional Knowledge Navigator agent deployed to Teams that helps employees access company information instantly.
